WELCOME TO MY GREENGINN ASSIGNMENT

1. Decided App and components layout on pen and paper.
2. Created react app, Github repo and pushed new project.
3. Decided on Material UI for interface and installed package
4. Created a basic layout for the app and a fake array to mimic the amount of buttons
5. Fetched pairs data to display actual value of the buttons
6. First approach to logic of pair choosing with pseudocode. Decided on keeping one state just to ensure the order was odd and even. This might need a later approach on how to avoid choosing the same option twice.
7. Once the object with the trading pair was correctly created, it can be passed via props to the component that shall show the data. It has its own async function to fetch the data according to the chosen pair.
8. Some styling was needed on the buttons, used display:grid to uniform the layout and tried to keep the buttons section as small as possible to have future room for the display of the values.
9. useEffect() is used in the SelectedPairValues component to display updated data.
